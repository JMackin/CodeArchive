Nick: write the methods for calling and parseing the json data for weather forecast, and a nice gui  to display it.

Caitlyn: work on a method to parse the json data for the radar image, and a gui function to display the image in a nice fashion.

* looks like everyone has been pretty busy coding away the classes are really starting to mature.
* methods to handel the image icons has pretty much been wrapped up.
* backend has finished the main code to handle json data and divie it up etween the different gui classes.
* I it's still kind of in parts but i think it wont be hard to put it together in to something that'll run for mondays presentation.
* because of conflicting schedules it's looking unlikely that we'll e meeting up tommorrow, but i'm still confident we can get it done.

----------------
* All of the guis are pretty far along callale from the main gui.
* radar map has a couple bugs. forecast class tweaks still being worked on.
* Got everyone syncronized and the classes working in tandem
* Getting closer to finished, looks like we just need to work on some tweaks.
* Plan on adding some superficial stuff later on.
* 

Ideas
----------------
* Caitlyn proposed adding a menu to switch between Radar views in the Radar panel
